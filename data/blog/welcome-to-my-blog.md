Welcome to my website / blog! In this post, I will introduce the various kinds of content I will be sharing as I start out my blogging journey.

## Where I am currently now in life
Before delving into the topic further, I will briefly share my background. I have recently finished my thid year as a chemical engineering undergraduate student in Nanyang Technological University (NTU), ending my most recent semester as a data analytics intern at Air Liquide Singapore. 

I was then called for National Service in Singapore and enlisted in July 2023, thereby having to disrupt my university studies before I could embark on my final year. While two years of hiatus before completing my degree may seem unfavourable, I saw this as an opportunity to build up on what I really want to do in life. 

## Software Development
One area of interest I have is in software development. While my degree is under chemical engineering, I fell in love with the power and beauty of programming few years back and decided to delve further into various topics through research attachments, internships and personal projects. 

What I intend to share in my blogs would be the things I have learnt along the way as I work on various projects from internships or personal works. 

## Entrepreneurship
In addition to software development, I am interested in entrepreneurship and aspire to create my own tech start-up one day. I strongly believe that software platforms have unlimited potential to provide value based on people's needs. This became my motivating factor to delve into the field of software engineering myself, with the overarching goal to bring value to people with the use of software platforms. 

## Books
I will also be sharing on some of the books that changed my way of thinking on various aspects in life. I've also recently bought a Kindle for myself so reading would be a lot easier on my end :joy:

## Conclusion
With that, feel free to reach out to me [here](/contact) for any suggestions on topics I can talk about! You can also connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minseo-kim-60a272202/) should you be interested.
